"""
Abstract class CassiopeiaSolver, for the phylogenetic inference module.

All algorithms are derived classes of this abstract class, and at a minimum
store an input character matrix and implement a method called `solve`. Each
derived class stores more information around the parameters necessary for
inferring a phylogenetic tree.

    CassiopeiaSolver is an abstract class that all inference algorithms derive
