    """Infer a layer of the potential graph.

    This function is invoked by `infer_potential_graph` and returns a layer
    of samples that represent evolutionary ancestors of the passed in source
    nodes. Ancestors are added to the layer if the distance from a pair of 
    source nodes to the ancestor is less than the specified distance
    threshold. The function returns a set of nodes to use as the next layer
    of the potential graph as well as the edges to add to the potential
    graph.

    The edge representation here is a bit unorthodox, as a way of avoiding
    the use of tuples. The edges are returned as concatenated numpy arrays of 
    length 2M (where M is the number of characters). The first M characters
    correspond to the first node in the edge and the latter half correspond
    to the second node.

    Args:
        source_nodes: A list of samples, represented by their character
            states.
        distance_threshold: Maximum hamming distance allowed between a pair of 
            source nodes through their ancestor.
        missing_state_indicator: State to treat as missing.

    Returns:
        A list of samples to be treated as the source nodes of the next
            layer and the edges connecting samples to one another.
