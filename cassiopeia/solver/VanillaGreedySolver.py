This file stores a subclass of GreedySolver, the VanillaGreedySolver. The
inference procedure here is the "vanilla" Cassiopeia-Greedy, originally proposed
in Jones et al, Genome Biology (2020). In essence, the algorithm proceeds by
recursively splitting samples into mutually exclusive groups based on the
presence, or absence, of the most frequently occurring mutation.

    TODO: Implement fuzzysolver
    The VanillaGreedySolver implements a top-down algorithm that optimizes
    for parsimony by recursively splitting the sample set based on the most
    presence, or absence, of the most frequent mutation. Multiple missing data
    imputation methods are included for handling the case when a sample has a
    missing value on the character being split, where presence or absence of the
    character is ambiguous. The user can also specify a missing data method.

    Args:
        character_matrix: A character matrix of observed character states for
            all samples
        missing_char: The character representing missing values
        missing_data_classifier: Takes either a string specifying one of the
            included missing data imputation methods, or a function
            implementing the user-specified missing data method. The default is
            the "average" method
        meta_data: Any meta data associated with the samples
        priors: Prior probabilities of observing a transition from 0 to any
            state for each character
        prior_function: A function defining a transformation on the priors
            in forming weights to scale frequencies

    Attributes:
        character_matrix: The character matrix describing the samples
        missing_char: The character representing missing values
        meta_data: Data table storing meta data for each sample
        priors: Prior probabilities of character state transitions
        weights: Weights on character/mutation pairs, derived from priors
        tree: The tree built by `self.solve()`. None if `solve` has not been
            called yet
        unique_character_matrix: A character matrix with duplicate rows filtered
            out

        character where presence or absence of the character is ambiguous.
