This file stores a subclass of CassiopeiaSolver, the DistanceSolver. Generally,
the inference procedures that inherit from this method will need to implement
methods for selecting "cherries" and updating the dissimilarity map. Methods
that will inherit from this class by default are Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA.
