"""
This file stores the basic data structure for Cassiopeia - the
CassiopeiaTree. This data structure will typically contain a character
matrix containing that character state information for all the cells in a given
clonal population (though this is not required). Other important data is also
stored here, like the priors for given character states as well any meta data
associated with this clonal  population.

When a solver has been called on this object, a tree 
will be added to the data structure at which point basic properties can be 
queried like the average tree depth or agreement between character states and
phylogeny.

This object can be passed to any CassiopeiaSolver subclass as well as any
analysis module, like a branch length estimator or rate matrix estimator

class CassiopeiaTree:
    """Basic tree object for Cassiopeia.

    This object stores the key attributes and functionalities a user might want
    for working with lineage tracing experiments. At its core, it stores
    three main items - a tree, a character matrix, and meta data associated
    with the data.

    The tree can be fed into the object via Ete3, Networkx, or can be inferred
    using one of the CassiopeiaSolver algorithms in the `solver` module. The
    tree here is only used for obtaining the _topology_ of the tree. The one
    exception is if the newick string has branch lengths, in which we transfer
    these values.

    A character matrix can be stored in the object, containing the states
    observed for each cell. In typical lineage tracing experiments, these are
    integer representations of the indels observed at each unique cut site. We
    track both an unmodified version of the character matrix (obtainable via
    the `get_original_character_matrix` method) that does not maintain
    consistency with the character states of the leaves, and a working character
    matrix (obtainable via the `get_modified_character_matrix` method) that
    is updated when the character states of leaves are changed.

    Meta data for cells or characters can also be stored in this object. These
    items can be categorical or numerical in nature. Common examples of cell
    meta data are the cluster identity, tissue identity, or number of target-site
    UMIs per cell. These items can be used in downstream analyses, for example
    the FitchCount algorithm which infers the number of transitions between
    categorical variables (e.g., tissues). Common examples of character meta
    data are the proportion of missing data for each character or the entropy
    of states. These are good statistics to have for feature selection.

    TODO(mattjones315): Add experimental meta data as arguments.
    TODO(mattjones315): Add functionality that mutates the underlying tree
        structure: pruning lineages, collapsing mutationless edges, and
        collapsing unifurcations. When this happens, be sure to make sure the 
        cached properties update.
    TODO(mattjones315): Add utility methods to compute the colless index
        and the cophenetic correlation wrt to some cell meta item
    TODO(sprillo): Add bulk set_times and set_branch_lengths methods
    TODO(mattjones315): Add bulk set_states method.

    Args:
        character_matrix: The character matrix for the lineage.
